# Project Setup Guide

## Prerequisites
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- Python (version 3.8 or higher) - for Python dependencies
- Flutter SDK (latest stable version) - for Flutter dependencies
- Android Studio or Xcode (for mobile development, if applicable)

## Cloning the Repository
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of this repository.

3. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```
   cd "Research_Project_25_26J_168"
   ```

## Setting Up Python Environment
1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install Python dependencies (if there's a requirements.txt file):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Setting Up Flutter
1. Ensure Flutter is installed and added to your PATH.
2. Run Flutter doctor to check for any issues:
   ```
   flutter doctor
   ```

3. If there's a pubspec.yaml file, install Flutter dependencies:
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Running the Project
- For Python scripts: Run the main Python file, e.g., `python main.py`
- For Flutter app: 
  - Connect a device or start an emulator
  - Run: `flutter run`

## Additional Notes
- Make sure all dependencies are installed before running.
- If you encounter any issues, check the prerequisites and ensure your environment is set up correctly.
- For more detailed instructions, refer to the project documentation or README file (if available).
